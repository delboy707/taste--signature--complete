# Emotional Mapping - Complete Guide

## Overview

The Taste Signature framework is fundamentally about **mapping sensory inputs to emotional outcomes**. This is the core differentiator from traditional sensory analysis.

## Key Principle

**Every sensory attribute triggers emotional responses. The app tracks, visualizes, and correlates these relationships.**

## Emotional Tracking Structure

### Appearance Stage Emotions
- **Anticipation**: Expectation building
- **Desire**: Want to consume
- **Excitement**: Visual stimulation
- **Happiness**: Positive visual impact
- **Curiosity**: Interest in trying

### Aroma Stage Emotions
- **Pleasure**: Olfactory enjoyment
- **Comfort**: Familiar, soothing
- **Nostalgia**: Memory trigger
- **Happiness**: Positive emotional lift
- **Energy**: Stimulating effect
- **Relaxation**: Calming influence

### Front of Mouth Emotions
- **Excitement**: Initial taste impact
- **Satisfaction**: Meeting expectations
- **Happiness**: Positive response
- **Pleasure**: Taste enjoyment

### Mid/Rear Mouth Emotions
- **Indulgence**: Luxurious feeling
- **Comfort**: Soothing mouthfeel
- **Satisfaction**: Flavor depth
- **Pleasure**: Continued enjoyment

### Aftertaste Emotions
- **Satisfaction**: Overall contentment
- **Completeness**: Fulfillment
- **Happiness**: Lasting positive feeling

## Core Visualizations

### 1. Emotional Mapping Chart
**Purpose**: Track all emotions across the consumption journey

**Shows**:
- Each emotion as a separate line
- How emotions evolve from Appearance → Aftertaste
- Which emotions peak at which stages
- Emotional patterns and trajectories

**Use Cases**:
- Identify emotional high points
- Spot emotional gaps
- Compare emotional journeys between products
- Optimize formulation for desired emotional outcomes

### 2. Shape of Emotion
**Purpose**: Overall emotional intensity curve

**Shows**:
- Average of all emotions per stage
- The emotional "arc" of the experience
- Whether emotion builds, sustains, or fades

**Insights**:
- Products with strong emotional finish
- Early vs. late emotional impact
- Consistent vs. variable emotional response

### 3. Emotional Profile Radar
**Purpose**: Aggregate emotional signature

**Shows**:
- All emotion types averaged across journey
- Product's dominant emotional characteristics
- Balanced vs. specialized emotional profile

**Strategy Uses**:
- Brand positioning
- Target audience alignment
- Portfolio differentiation

### 4. Sensory-to-Emotional Correlation Heatmap
**Purpose**: THE MOST CRITICAL VISUALIZATION

**Shows**:
- Which sensory attributes drive which emotions
- Strength of relationships (color-coded)
- Unexpected correlations
- Optimization opportunities

**Reading the Heatmap**:
- **Green (Strong Positive)**: This sensory attribute strongly triggers this emotion
- **Light Green (Moderate)**: Clear relationship
- **Yellow (Weak)**: Some connection
- **Gray (Neutral)**: Little to no relationship

**Example Insights**:
- "Sweetness drives Happiness (0.72 correlation)"
- "Aroma Intensity triggers Nostalgia (0.68)"
- "Bitterness creates Indulgence (0.55)"

### 5. Emotional Drivers Analysis
**Purpose**: Rank emotions by impact

**Shows**:
- Top 5 emotions for the product
- Average intensity
- Peak moments
- Stages where present

**Strategic Value**:
- Marketing messaging
- Product claims
- Consumer communication
- Brand storytelling

## How Emotional Mapping Works

### Data Collection
Each consumption stage captures:
1. **Sensory inputs** (intensity, attributes)
2. **Emotional outputs** (5-6 emotions per stage)
3. **Relationships** between them

### Correlation Calculation
```
For each Sensory Attribute:
    For each Emotional Outcome:
        Calculate correlation strength
        Classify relationship
        Visualize in heatmap
```

### Pattern Recognition
The system identifies:
- **Dominant emotions**: Which feelings are strongest
- **Emotional triggers**: Which sensory inputs cause emotions
- **Journey patterns**: How emotions evolve
- **Unexpected relationships**: Novel sensory-emotional links

## Practical Applications

## Best Practices

### Data Entry
✅ **DO**:
- Rate emotions honestly based on actual feeling
- Use full 0-10 scale
- Consider subtle differences between stages
- Track changes over consumption

❌ **DON'T**:
- Default to middle (5) for everything
- Rush through emotional ratings
- Confuse similar emotions (e.g., Happiness vs. Pleasure)
- Ignore weak emotions (0-3 range is valuable data)

### Analysis
✅ **DO**:
- Look for patterns across products
- Compare to category benchmarks
- Focus on high-correlation relationships
- Test hypotheses with A/B comparisons

❌ **DON'T**:
- Over-interpret single data points
- Ignore context (occasion, mood, etc.)
- Assume correlation = causation without testing
- Neglect low-intensity emotions

### Strategic Use
✅ **DO**:
- Align emotions with brand values
- Build product stories from emotional data
- Use emotional language in marketing
- Train teams on emotional framework

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use jargon with consumers
- Overcomplicate messaging
- Ignore functional benefits
- Make claims unsupported by data

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Product Emotional Profiling
1. Log 5+ products in category
2. Export emotional data
3. Cluster by emotional similarity
4. Identify white space segments

### Longitudinal Emotional Tracking
1. Re-test same product over time

2. Average emotional responses
3. Segment by emotional reaction types
4. Target high-responders

## Interpreting Correlations

### Strong Positive (0.7-1.0)
**Meaning**: Sensory attribute reliably triggers emotion

**Action**: Maintain or increase this attribute

**Example**: "Sweetness → Happiness (0.82)"
- Sugar level directly drives positive mood
- Reformulation must preserve sweetness
- Marketing can emphasize "feel-good taste"

### Moderate (0.4-0.7)
**Meaning**: Clear relationship but other factors involved

**Action**: Optimize in context

**Example**: "Creaminess → Comfort (0.58)"
- Texture contributes but not sole driver
- Combine with other comfort cues
- Test threshold levels

### Weak (0.2-0.4)
**Meaning**: Minor connection or indirect effect

**Action**: Investigate further or deprioritize

**Example**: "Bitterness → Energy (0.25)"
- Relationship exists but unpredictable
- May be context-dependent
- Not reliable formulation lever

### Neutral (0-0.2)
**Meaning**: No meaningful relationship

**Action**: These attributes don't drive this emotion

**Example**: "Saltiness → Nostalgia (0.08)"
- Independent variables
- Don't expect salt to trigger memories
- Look elsewhere for nostalgia drivers

## Case Study Example

### Product: Dark Chocolate Bar

**Emotional Mapping Results**:
- **Dominant Emotions**: Indulgence (8.5), Satisfaction (8.2), Comfort (7.8)

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```javascript
experience = {
    stages: {
        appearance: {
            sensory: {...},
            emotions: {
                anticipation: 7,
                desire: 8,
                excitement: 6,
                // ...
            }
        },
        // ... 4 more stages
    }
}
```

### Correlation Algorithm
```javascript
For each sensory attribute S:
    For each emotion E:
        correlation = (S_value * E_value) / 100
        if correlation >= 0.7: Strong
        else if correlation >= 0.4: Moderate
        else if correlation >= 0.2: Weak
        else: Neutral
```

### Visualization Pipeline
1. Collect multi-stage emotional data
2. Aggregate by emotion type
3. Calculate stage averages
4. Generate line charts
5. Compute correlations
6. Render heatmap
7. Extract top drivers

## FAQ

**Q: How many emotions should I track?**
A: 5-6 per stage is optimal. More creates fatigue, fewer misses nuance.

**Q: Can I add custom emotions?**
A: Yes, but validate they're distinct and measurable.

**Q: How do I know if correlations are real?**
A: Test with multiple products and look for consistency.

**Q: What if no strong correlations appear?**
A: May indicate complex/multi-factorial drivers or need more data points.

**Q: Should emotions be same across all stages?**
A: No! Stage-specific emotions capture journey dynamics.

## Conclusion

Emotional mapping transforms sensory data from descriptive to **predictive and strategic**.

By understanding which sensory attributes drive which emotions, you can:
- Design products with intent
- Communicate benefits emotionally
- Differentiate in crowded markets
- Build stronger brand connections

**The heatmap is your roadmap. Use it.**
