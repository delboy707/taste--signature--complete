      "expertTips": "West Coast IPAs are typically clear with white head. New England/Hazy IPAs should be turbid with persistent head. Golden color suggests fresh hops; brown tones may indicate oxidation."

      "expertTips": "IPA aroma should be dominated by fresh hops. Citrus and tropical fruit aromas indicate modern hop varieties. Grassy or onion-like notes suggest old hops or poor storage."

      "expertTips": "IPA finish should be bitter but not astringent. Long finish (30-60 seconds) is typical. Clean, pleasant bitterness encourages another sip. Harsh or metallic finish indicates poor technique."
